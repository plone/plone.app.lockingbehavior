Changelog
=========


1.0 (unreleased)
----------------

* Fixed problem: locks were not released when editing content and saving
  it without changing anything. Fixed by using new IEditFinishedEvent instead
  of IObjectModifiedEvent.
  [jbaumann]

* Fixed problem which caused widget traversal to fail.
  The edit form is now protected for non-anonymous user, since locking for
  anyonmous users does not work anyway.
  [jbaumann]

* Initial implementation
  [jbaumann]
